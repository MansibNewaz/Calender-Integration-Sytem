Calender-Integration-System 
I Found Very absurd the idea that NSU student had to refer to a linked pdf containing really crucial Deadlines that affect One's Finance. Also the Amount of revision Each semester Calender takes is also something often becomes unreliable. 
This Particular Project Aims solve the following issues

2. Furthermore, The ideal objective is to automate the hectic process of registering calender and the manual tasks of making a calender on google. 
3. Google uses CSV Files with appropriate naming and can translate them into each Unique Calender. 
4. With proper webScraping , Proper Data manipulation NSU semester Calender Can meet the standard of Google import Calender System. 
5. which in turn can be automated. 
6. Any revision will also be updated on the calender. 
7.
